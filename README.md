# Vancouver DanceJS

DanceJS is coming to Vancouver!

### Call for presenters/performers

If you are interested in performing or presenting, create an issue with either
the `[perform]` or `[present]` prefix. For performers, include a link to your
SoundCloud (or wherever else you host your music) and any relevant info about
the set you want to play. For presenters, include a description of
what you hope to present about.

Alternatively, you can email me at [admin@stephenbelanger.com](mailto:admin@stephenbelanger.com).
